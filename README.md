# Briefcase Challenge

This repository contains a program that simulates a briefcase challenge, where the user needs to input a specific combination to unlock the briefcase and access sensitive information. The program is written in C language.

# Instructions:

   1) Upon running the program, you will be prompted to accept the challenge as Agent Vinod.

   2) If you choose to accept the challenge, you will be presented with a briefcase combination lock and given five chances to input the correct digits.

   3) Enter the digits one by one as prompted by the program.

   4) If you successfully enter the correct combination (4-5-6-7), the briefcase will unlock, and you will gain access to the sensitive information.

   5) If you fail to enter the correct combination within the given chances, the program will display an "X" for each incorrect digit entered.

   6) After completing the challenge, the program will display a success message if the briefcase was unlocked or a message stating that you left the mission if you chose not to accept the challenge.
